# Contact Tracing analysis files

This repository contains a collection of scripts used to prepare, analyze and plot datasets that were used in https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3353255

They consist primarily of (1) proximity inference among collections of WiFi AP observations from multiple devices within the same location and (2) Simulations for proof-of-concept test of the proposed contact tracing approach.
